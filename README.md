It will be a website for a brand new zoo. There will be different sections for the avians, land mammals, and aquatic animals that we currently have or plan to have in the near future. Each page will have the name of the anmimal, it species, weight, gender, and health of the animal.We will also have a seperate sections for the tickets to ticket prices, showing how buying more reduces the cost per ticket. We can also show the scheduled for that month to draw in attention giving people more time to be able to prepare for future visits.

Week 2:

Here is what I did this week. Working on the modeling portion of the assignment I quickly was able to form the views, those being the different type of animals I plan to have (avian, aquatic, and land animals though I will probably stick mostly to mammals) prices and events. For the controllers, for now I will only be utilizing 2 different ones one for the animals and one for the prices of ticket and events. Then I had to come to determine how many databases I needed, which ended up being 3. One for the price, animals and event/schedule. Now that I had determined the amount databases, I then determined what should go in them. For price I used CostID so the system can pull up the choices, TicketPrices to determine the cost of each one, and the amount how many you intend to buy. For the animals I used AnimalIDÂ  so the system can pull up the animals in question, name so we can display the nickname given by guest, species will display what type of animal it is, weight for how much it weighs, gender for its gender, health will be for the current health status of the animal switching between (Surgery, Zoochosis, Sick, Healthy, Died). For the event/schedule I used EventId so the system can pull up the choices, EventTitle will be what packages are given and what animals you get, ScehduleDate will be for the time and day the animals go to perform. Then with the creation of the 3 databases I named the 3 separate DbContext classes ones, named ZooPriceContext, ZooEventAndScheduleContext, and ZooAnimalListContext.
