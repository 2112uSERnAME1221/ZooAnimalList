It will be a website for a brand new zoo. There will be different sections for the avians, land mammals, and aquatic animals that we currently have or plan to have in the near future. Each page will have the name of the anmimal, it species, weight, gender, and health of the animal.We will also have a seperate sections for the tickets to ticket prices, showing how buying more reduces the cost per ticket. We can also show the scheduled for that month to draw in attention giving people more time to be able to prepare for future visits.
